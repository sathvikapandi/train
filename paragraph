🔑 Key Features

Compartment Occupancy Detection

Install sensors (IR counters, weight sensors, or CCTV+AI) in each general compartment.

Sensors track number of passengers / crowd density in real time.

Data Transmission

Occupancy data is sent via IoT (LoRa, GSM, or WiFi at stations) to the train server/control system.

Loco Pilot Dashboard

A simple screen in the engine showing each compartment’s status:

🟢 Safe (under capacity)

🟡 Busy (near limit)

🔴 Full (exceeds safe capacity)

Automatic Alerts

If a compartment exceeds safe capacity, the loco pilot gets an alert notification.

Control center is also notified.

Extra Compartment Management

System suggests: “Attach one general coach at next station.”

Control center sends instruction to station staff to keep a spare compartment ready.

📊 Flow of the System

Passenger enters → sensor updates count.

Occupancy data → sent to central server in real time.

Central server → updates loco pilot dashboard + control room screen.

If threshold crossed → alert raised.

Next station staff notified → prepare extra coach.

Loco pilot confirms → extra coach added.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Hardware:

IR sensors at compartment doors (cheap option).

Or weight sensors under bogie for crowd estimation.

CCTV with AI (advanced option).

Communication: IoT modules (LoRa, 4G, or Railway WiFi).

Backend: Node.js / Django server to collect data.

Dashboard:

Loco Pilot → Minimal interface with color alerts.

Control Room → Web dashboard with train-wise occupancy map.

🚀 Benefits

Passenger safety (avoid accidents due to overcrowding).

Better train operations (dynamic coach management).

Data insights: Identify peak routes/times where extra coaches are regularly needed.
